		<h1 style="margin-top:10px;">My Teaching Philosophy</h1>
		<p> My teaching philosophy centers on creating a supportive and inclusive learning environment where students feel empowered to engage with challenging concepts. As I am primarily hoping to become a Grade 7–12 Math and Science teacher, 
		I am passionate
		about disrupting negative perspectives about Math and helping students discover the beauty and logic behind mathematical concepts. I strive to create an engaging 
		and supportive learning environment where students feel confident exploring problem-solving strategies and making connections between math and the real world.
		Through hands-on activities and real-life applications, I aim to inspire curiosity and help students develop a deeper appreciation for both Math and Physics.
		</p>
		
		<h1>Experience</h1>
		<p>My journey in teaching began in high school when I worked as a peer tutor, helping classmates navigate Math and Science. This early experience sparked a passion
		for education, which I carried into university, refining my teaching style along the way. As an undergraduate at Queen’s University, I worked as a teaching assistant
		at the Math Help Centre, providing drop-in support for students across all undergraduate Math and Statistics courses. After earning my Mathematics degree, I pursued
		a Master’s at Simon Fraser University, where I gained extensive teaching experience as a Teaching Assistant. During my Master’s, I had the opportunity to independently
		lead tutorial sections, allowing me to develop essential teaching skills such as lesson planning and classroom management. These graduate experiences solidified my passion
		for teaching, making it a natural choice to continue into a Bachelor of Education. I am now completing my BEd., actively participating in practicum sessions where I 
		learn from experienced educators while honing my skills in preparation for a career in teaching.		</p>

            "Learning is a lifelong process of acquiring knowledge, skills, and values that empowers individuals to grow, adapt, and contribute meaningfully to their communities. Learning happens when students feel safe, supported, and engaged in an inclusive environment that encourages curiosity, critical thinking, and active participation. As a teacher, I am a facilitator of learning, a role model, and a mentor who guides students to discover their potential, build confidence, and develop a love for learning. Learning is most effective when it is student-centered, rooted in real-world contexts, and tailored to meet the diverse needs, interests, and experiences of each learner. As a teacher, I believe in fostering a classroom culture that values respect, collaboration, and open communication, where mistakes are seen as opportunities to grow and all voices are heard.",
            "As a beginning teacher commited to CRRP, I would prioritize creating a school culture that celebrates diversity, fosters inclusion, and promotes equity. This begins with integrating diverse cultures, histories, and identities into the curriculum and school environment, ensuring every student deels represented and valued. I would emphasize the importance of student coice and agency by providing opporunties for students to share their perspectives and influence decisions. Equity in access to resources and opportunitieswould be a key focus addressing systemic barriers that may disadvantage maginalized students. Incorporating socal justice education into the classroom mwould empower students to critically analyze issues such as inequality and privilege encouraging them to become informed empathetic citizens. Building strong relationships within the school community—among students, families and staff—would create a sense of belonging and mutual respect.",
			"During practicum, mentor teachers expect teacher candidates to demonstate initiative and engagement by actively observing and supporting classroom routines, planning and delivering lessons, and assisting with classroom management, Building strong relationships with students contributing to activities, and proactively seeking feedback are essential for growth. Additionally, showing a commitment to reflective practice and being adaptable to feedback highlights a willingness to improve and learn. These actions demonstate dedication to both teaching and the broader school community.",
			"Reflecting on the adaptive expert model in teacher education has been transformative in recognizing my own biases and assumptions about teaching and learning. Initially, I approached education with a set of common-sense theories, often influenced by my own experiences as a student. I assumed that effective teaching primarily involved delivering content clearly and that learners would naturally absorb information. However, so far in this program, I’ve learned to critically examine these assumptions. For example, I’ve come to understand that learners bring diverse backgrounds, experiences, and learning preferences, which profoundly impact how they engage with material. This has highlighted the importance of creating inclusive learning environments that cater to varied needs.",
